/**

 *
 * ISA-specific helper functions for locked memory accesses.
 *
 * Note that these functions are not embedded in the ISA description
 * because they operate on the *physical* address rather than the
 * virtual address.  In the current M5 design, the physical address is
 * not accessible from the ISA description, only from the CPU model.
 * Thus the CPU is responsible for calling back to the ISA (here)
 * after the address translation has been performed to allow the ISA
 * to do these manipulations based on the physical address.
