# The behaviour of this traffic generator is specified in a
# configuration file, and this file describes a state transition graph
# where each state is a specific generator behaviour. Examples include
# idling, generating linear address sequences, random sequences and
# replay of captured traces. By describing these behaviours as states,
# it is straight forward to create very complex behaviours, simply by
# arranging them in graphs. The graph transitions can also be
# annotated with probabilities, effectively making it a Markov Chain.
