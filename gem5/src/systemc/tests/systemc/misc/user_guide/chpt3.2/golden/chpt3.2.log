SystemC Simulation
Synopsys is delivering great value through Scen
Found Count is 1
ic. I cannot wait to use Scen
Found Count is 2
ic
Compiler and Scen
Found Count is 3
ic Simulator. I am learning a lot about modeling using
Scen
Found Count is 4
ic.

This is a testcase for my first Scen
Found Count is 5
ic program. I have learnt modeling using
Scen
Found Count is 6
ic and would now like to check if I can really program in Scen
Found Count is 7
ic. There is
no doubt in my mind that Scen
Found Count is 8
ic is the best way to model hardware. The Scen
Found Count is 9
ic
Compiler will make a lot of things easy by implementing by refined Scen
Found Count is 10
ic
models.
