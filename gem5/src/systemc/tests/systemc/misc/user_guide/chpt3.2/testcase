Synopsys is delivering great value through Scenic. I cannot wait to use Scenic
Compiler and Scenic Simulator. I am learning a lot about modeling using
Scenic.

This is a testcase for my first Scenic program. I have learnt modeling using
Scenic and would now like to check if I can really program in Scenic. There is
no doubt in my mind that Scenic is the best way to model hardware. The Scenic
Compiler will make a lot of things easy by implementing by refined Scenic
models.
