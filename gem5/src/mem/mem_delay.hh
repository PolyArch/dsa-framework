/**
 * This abstract component provides a mechanism to delay
 * packets. It can be spliced between arbitrary ports of the memory
 * system and delays packets that pass through it.
 *
 * Specialisations of this abstract class should override at least one
 * of delayReq, delayResp, deleySnoopReq, delaySnoopResp. These
 * methods receive a PacketPtr as their argument and return a delay in
 * Ticks. The base class implements an infinite buffer to hold delayed
 * packets until they are ready. The intention is to use this
 * component for rapid prototyping of other memory system components
 * that introduce a packet processing delays.
 *
 * NOTE: Packets may be reordered if the delays aren't constant.
