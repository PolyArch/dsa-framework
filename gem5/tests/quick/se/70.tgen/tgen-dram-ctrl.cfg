# This format supports comments using the '#' symbol as the leading
# character of the line
#
# The file format contains [STATE]+ [INIT] [TRANSITION]+ in any order,
# where the states are the nodes in the graph, init describes what
# state to start in, and transition describes the edges of the graph.
#
# STATE <id> <duration (ticks)> <type>
#
# State IDLE idles
#
# States LINEAR and RANDOM have additional <percent reads> <start addr>
# <end addr> <access size (bytes)> <min period (ticks)> <max period (ticks)>
# <data limit (bytes)>
#
# State TRACE plays back a pre-recorded trace once
#
# Addresses are expressed as decimal numbers, both in the
# configuration and the trace file. The period in the linear and
# random state is from a uniform random distribution over the
# interval. If a specific value is desired, then the min and max can
# be set to the same value.
