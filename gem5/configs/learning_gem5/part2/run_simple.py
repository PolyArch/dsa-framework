""" Simple config/run script for the HelloObject

This is probably the simplest gem5 config file you can possibly create.
It creates a Root object and one *very* simple SimObject and simulates the
system. Since there are no events, this "simulation" should finish immediately

# Create an instantiation of the simobject you created

# instantiate all of the objects we've created above
