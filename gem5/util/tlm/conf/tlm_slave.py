# Create a system with a Crossbar and a TrafficGenerator as CPU:
system = System()
system.membus = IOXBar(width = 16)
system.physmem = SimpleMemory() # This must be instanciated, even if not needed
system.cpu = TrafficGen(config_file = "conf/tgen.cfg")
system.clk_domain = SrcClockDomain(clock = '1.5GHz',
    voltage_domain = VoltageDomain(voltage = '1V'))

# Create a external TLM port:
system.tlm = ExternalSlave()
system.tlm.addr_ranges = [AddrRange('512MB')]
system.tlm.port_type = "tlm_slave"
system.tlm.port_data = "transactor"

# Route the connections:
system.cpu.port = system.membus.slave
system.system_port = system.membus.slave
system.membus.master = system.tlm.port

# Start the simulation:
root = Root(full_system = False, system = system)
root.system.mem_mode = 'timing'
m5.instantiate()
m5.simulate() #Simulation time specified later on commandline
