# Sample stats config file (O3CPU) for m5stats2streamline.py
#
# Stats grouped together will show as grouped in Streamline.
# E.g.,
#
# commit_inst_count =
#     system.cpu#.commit.committedInsts
#     system.cpu#.commit.commitSquashedInsts
#
# will display the inst counts (committed/squashed) as a stacked line chart.
# Charts will still be configurable in Streamline.

[PER_CPU_STATS]
# '#' will be automatically replaced with the correct CPU id.
