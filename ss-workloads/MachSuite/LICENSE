MachSuite License Information

----
Non-legal summary:

MachSuite is a collection of benchmarks, some of which are derived from other
authors. As a result, some of the source files in MachSuite have different
licenses. However, all of the files in MachSuite are licensed under compatible
terms, and MachSuite as a whole can be thought of as a BSD-3 compatible package.
Each benchmark contains its own license header as necessary when derived from
another source and all of those licenses are included in this file as well.
All other files in MachSuite use the MachSuite BSD-3 license included below.

What does this mean to you? Treat MachSuite as a BSD-3 licensed codebase. You
can use it, modify it, distribute it, etc., so long as you include the license
and copyright information. Just be aware that many people deserve credit for
the code, so include this license file if you use it.
